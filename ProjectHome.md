The project aims to develop an automatic attendance system on an embedded device (Openmoko) with wireless facility to store the data digitally on a centralized server. It will facilitate the teachers to mark the attendance on the embedded device which is touch-screen enabled. It will also have the facility of writing notes and remarks about any student on the device. The data and attendance will be stored on a centralized database server which can be accessed from a teacherâ€™s personal computer. All the communication and data transfer will take place wirelessly.
The hardware platform for this project is a mobile device called Neo Freerunner. The applications are developed using the Openmoko software stack.
