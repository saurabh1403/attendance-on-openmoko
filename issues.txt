1) Opening a file in ios::ate erase the previous data

2) Sending a file to IP 192.168.1.2 makes all processes hang

3) attendance.cpp: gtk_main_quit is not working as expected. It is called multiple times, yet the parent window is not destroyed.

4) php script sometimes, is not able to bind socket to a particular IP for some time. <closed>

5) gtk files are not getting compiled using openmoko build image, whereas it is getting compiled with openmoko toolchain.

6) Sometimes, ssh of root@phone doesn't work, specially then when usb connection takes place more than once. 
<resolved>
==> usb0 doesn;t get the static IP automatically. use the command : sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
and then 
==> ssh root@192.168.0.202

7) compiling C++ code using openmoko toolchain:
Change the following things:
	=> src/Makefile.am : replace source files name extension: .c to .cpp
	=> src/Makefile.am : Change AM_CFLAGS to AM_CXXFLAGS
	=> configure.ac    : change AC_PROG_CC to AC_PROG_CXX    

run "make distclean" and then "make"
